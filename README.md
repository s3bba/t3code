# Fork details

This is a personal fork. It contains features I need for testing. All features are experimental, and I do not consider them fully done yet.

## Changes

- `feat/nix-flake-support`: Adds Nix flake packaging/build setup for this fork.
- `feat/nix-flake-devshell-integration`: Adds Nix flake dev shell integration and the runtime toggle.
- `feat/ctrl-enter-send`: Adds configurable Ctrl+Enter-to-send behavior in the chat composer.
- `fix/session-resume`: Reuses persisted provider resume cursor when live runtime session is missing.

Stack of all changes is on `stack/all`.

# T3 Code

T3 Code is a minimal web GUI for coding agents (currently Codex and Claude, more coming soon).

## How to use

> [!WARNING]
> You need to have [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) installed and authorized for T3 Code to work.

```bash
npx t3
```

You can also just install the desktop app. It's cooler.

Install the [desktop app from the Releases page](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/releases)
